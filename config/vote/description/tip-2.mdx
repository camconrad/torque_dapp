## Summary

This proposal suggests expanding Torque to include digital asset trading, virtual card services, a real-world ATM network, halting the initial liquidity program discussed in the previous vote, and delisting from Uniswap in preparation for NewDEX listing (holders don't need to do anything). With these updates, we'll deliver a full-service, integrated offering for digital asset investors that rivals leading custodial exchanges while enabling users to maintain complete asset ownership.

## Motivation

It has become clear "an automation protocol to streamline saving" is hard to grasp. For this reason, we propose repositioning to a self-custody digital asset exchange. A tailored offering such as that listed above would increase attractiveness to a broader audience of digital asset investors.

Furthermore, the decision to halt the initial liquidity program and delist TORQ from Uniswap in favor of listing on NewDEX aligns with our strategic vision to optimize liquidity and accessibility for our users. NewDEX will offer a more custom environment for Torque, with potential for increased visibility, liquidity, and trading volumes within our digital asset exchange ecosystem.

## Implementation

This proposal should be implemented in phases starting with the release of our new website and following that our reimagined web app which builds upon current foundations and introduces a more mature feel to the brand. TORQ will become listed on NewDEX and operations continue as normal. Once the ATM details have been finalized by Torque Inc., they'll be made available.

## Conclusion

By expanding Torque to include trading, virtual cards, ATMs, halting the initial liquidity program, and pursuing NewDEX listing, we aim to position Torque as a leading player in the digital asset ecosystem. These strategic initiatives not only enhance user experience but also broaden our reach in the ever-evolving blockchain space. We look forward to the support and collaboration of the Torque community as we continue on our journey in building a more transparent, resilient, and economic financial system.

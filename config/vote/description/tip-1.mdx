## Summary

This proposal suggests enabling reward distribution for Torque (TORQ) liquidity providers across four ecosystem pools as a starting point for the liquidity program. The Torque liquidity program distributes TORQ automatically through Boost/Borrow and via bi-weekly airdrops to the pools discussed herein. The program shall be managed by core contributor Torque Inc.

## Implementation

One way to achieve this would be utilizing Uniswap’s Staker [1] contract. In that case, LPs would be required to transfer custody of their NFT to the contract. But, due to examples such as RBN [2], we propose to handle reward calculations most simply off-chain while allowing liquidity providers to maintain custody of their LP NFTs (provided by Uniswap). Off-chain calculations for incentives have become popular with solutions such as Merkl [3].

To fund this initial setup of the liquidity program, 360m TORQ shall be allocated for a duration of 90 days with 4m TORQ to be rewarded per day and distributed bi-weekly via airdrop. A sheet has been created for live community tracking of the program’s bi-weekly results [4].

The manager address is here: 0x93bb6a01b962A0d8bB0d974465ccdc3B9906C19C. Finally, reward distributions are based on the duration and size of any given LPs position(s). Full range positions containing TORQ/WETH and USDC/TUSD at or near 50:50 ratio (within 25%) and supplies of TUSD or USDC to Ajna through the Summer interface are eligible. A form for liquidity providers has been created to ensure proper communication when needed [5].

## Pools

| Pool        | Platform       | Action       | Daily Supply |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| TORQ/WETH   | Uniswap V3 0.3 | Pair TORQ/WETH | 1m         |
| USDC/TUSD   | Uniswap V3 0.01| Pair USDC/TUSD | 1m         |
| TORQ/TUSD   | Summer/Ajna    | Supply TUSD    | 1m         |
| TORQ/USDC   | Summer/Ajna    | Supply USDC    | 1m         |

## Conclusion

Great liquidity depth across pools is a key component to a healthy ecosystem. Through this initial implementation, Torque will begin the process of enhancing its related liquidity pools. As a result, we aim for digital asset investors to enjoy minimal slippage during trading activity and power the use of Torque (TORQ) as collateral across Ajna markets via Summer.
